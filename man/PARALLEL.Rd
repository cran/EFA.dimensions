\title{Parallel analysis of eigenvalues (random data only)}
\description{Generates eigenvalues for random data sets with specified 
	numbers of variables and cases. Typically, the eigenvalues derived from an actual 
	data set are compared to the eigenvalues derived from the random data.  In Horn's 
	original description of this procedure, the mean eigenvalues from the random data 
	served as the comparison baseline, whereas the more common current practice is to 
	use the eigenvalues that correspond to the desired percentile (typically the 95th) 
	of the distribution of random data eigenvalues.  Factors or components are retained 
	as long as the ith eigenvalue from the actual data is greater than the ith eigenvalue 
	from the random data. This function produces only random data eigenvalues and it does 
	not take real data as input. See the rawpar function in this package for parallel 
	analyses that also involve real data.

\details{
The PARALLEL function permits users to specify PCA or PAF or image as the 
factor extraction method. Principal components eigenvalues are often used to determine the number  
of common factors. This is the default in most statistical software packages, and it is the  
primary practice in the literature. It is also the method used by many factor analysis experts, including 
Cattell, who often examined principal components eigenvalues in his scree plots to determine 
the number of common factors. Principal components eigenvalues are based on all of the variance  
in correlation matrices, including both the variance that is shared among variables and the  
variances that are unique to the variables. In contrast, principal axis eigenvalues are based  
solely on the shared variance among the variables. The procedures are qualitatively different.
Some therefore claim that the eigenvalues from one extraction method should not be used to determine the 
number of factors for another extraction method. The PAF option in the extract argument for the
PARALLEL function was included solely for research purposes. It is best to use PCA as the extraction 
method for regular data analyses. The MAP test (also in this package) is generally more suitable for 
determining the number of common factors.
